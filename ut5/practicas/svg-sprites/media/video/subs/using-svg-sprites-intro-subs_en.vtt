WEBVTT - Using SVG Sprites: Introduction

1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.149
Hello and welcome to using SVG sprites.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.399
My name is Craig Campbell and I will be

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.649
your instructor for this course. In this

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.718
short course I'm going to teach you a

5
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.878
couple of different methods for using

6
00:00:12.879 -->00:00:18.369
SVG sprites in HTML. Now SVG stands for

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.669
Scalable Vector Graphic and an SVG file

8
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.029
is an XML based graphic which, as its

9
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.939
name implies, can be scaled without using

10
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.939
quality. If we take a bitmap graphic such

11
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.328
as a PNG file or a JPG file and try to

12
00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.319
scale it up, as you can see it loses some

13
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.119
of its quality. Its edges become

14
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.029
pixelated and blurry. On the other hand

15
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.479
if we take a look at an SVG file, we can

16
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.849
take this graphic and scale it up as

17
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.068
much as we want to, and as you can see, it

18
00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.248
keeps its nice crisp edges. So there's a

19
00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.518
great advantage to using SVG's over

20
00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.939
JPEGs or PNGs if the circumstances call

21
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.189
for it. So in this course I'm going to

22
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.438
show you a couple of techniques for

23
00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.589
combining multiple vector graphics into

24
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.709
a single SVG object. And then we'll look

25
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.539
at how to display those shapes or

26
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.959
sprites one at a time by calling on that

27
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.898
SVG object. So we've got a lot to learn

28
00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.059
in a short amount of time. And in the

29
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.688
next lesson

30
00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.819
we'll get started. Thank you for watching

31
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.570
and I'll see you then.

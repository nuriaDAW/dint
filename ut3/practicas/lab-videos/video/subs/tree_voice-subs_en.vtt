2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.000
Call me Virginia.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.559
My parents named me after Virgina Woolf,

4
00:00:07.638 --> 00:00:08.880
a famous writer.

5
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.519
As a child I lived with my siblings and parents 
in a house full of animals and books,

6
00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:20.000
Noah's ark we called it, 
but we could also have called it the house of books.

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.119
One day while walking through the forest we found 
a house built in the top of a tree.

8
00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:28.039
Inside was a book.

9
00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:29.960
I opened it and began to read it.

10
00:00:30.798 --> 00:00:34.200
When I finished it another book had replaced it.

11
00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.439
I never knew who left me those books, 
nor how he knew I finished them.

12
00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.240
It was always a mystery.

13
00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:45.200
Sometimes my brothers would accompany me and we would read aloud,

14
00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:50.240
other times I didn't seem to be reading, but listening to a voice.

15
00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:56.719
It was the voice of the tree, 
telling me this story so that one day I could write it down.
